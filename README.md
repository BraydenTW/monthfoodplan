# Monthly Meal Planner

This is a software where you can store all the meals/foods that you will need to get a the grocery store and what you will have to prepare for the day.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository

(NOTE): save.php is not meant to be navigated to directly. Clicking the save button on the index.php page goes to save.php and back to the index file.

Please tell me if there are any features that should be added in or any bugs that should be fixed. All the feedback helps!

## Features

Below are the awesome features of the software.

### Saves Your Data

With just one click of the "save" button, your meals, external links, and favorites will be saved. It will save the current month's data and the upcoming month.

### Tracks Your Favorites

Instead of typing in all the same information over and over, why not use a favorite? They save your links and meal title across the whole calender making it easier to duplicate your favorite meals over the month.

### External Links

The use of external links are helpful with the growth of the internet. Just attach the link to a website with the recipe you want and you will be able to access it by clicking the cookbook icon.

### Sets the Month Information Automatically

No matter what month it is, the dates will adjust to the month's schedule. Days not included have a gray background color.

### Mobile Mode for Tablets

If you want to use an iPad, Samsung Tablet, Kindle, or whatever you want, the layout and hover effects are minified making it easy to use.

### Looks Nice

Automatically sets the month schedule to whatever is the layout. A simple UI set to change in the near future.

## What's coming...
