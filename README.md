## Features

Below are the awesome features of the software.

### Saves Your Data

With just one click of the "save" button, your meals, external links, and favorites will be saved. It will save the current month's data and the upcoming month.

### Tracks Your Favorites

Instead of typing in all the same information over and over, why not use a favorite? They save your links and meal title across the whole calender making it easier to duplicate your favorite meals over the month.

### External Links

The use of external links are helpful with the growth of the internet. Just attach the link to a website with the recipe you want and you will be able to access it by clicking the cookbook icon.

### Looks Nice

Automatically sets the month schedule to whatever is the layout. A simple UI set to change in the near future.

## What's coming...

Oh I'll tell you what's coming! Soon, many themes will be released to the users where they can customize their calender to make them feel good.
